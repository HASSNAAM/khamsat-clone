# Khamsat Clone

Welcome to the **Khamsat Clone**! Because why settle for five when you can have five... more?

## What is this?

This project is a playful imitation of Khamsat, where we take the spirit of freelancing and multiply it by five (or more!).

## Features

- **Multiple Copies of Titles**: Because one title is just not enough to get the message across.
- **Star Ratings**: Our services are so good, they get rated five stars... five times!
- **Arabic All the Way**: We're so Arabic, even our images speak the language.
- **Buttons that Go Nowhere**: Why go somewhere when you can stay here and laugh at the irony?

## Technologies

- **HTML**: The canvas of our quirky masterpiece.
- **CSS**: Adding colors that make you wonder if we're serious.
- **Font Awesome**: For when regular stars just won't cut it.
- **JavaScript**: The magic behind our button that pretends to do something.

## Contact Us

Have questions? Want to tell us how many titles are too many? Send us a message, we'll probably respond with a joke.
